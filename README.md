# waveshare_epaper
## In this project for University I wrote a Linux kernel driver for the Waveshare 4.3" e-Paper Display 

Here I publishing my source code and the documentation I wrote for University. The Documentation is only available in German.
Unfortunality I was not able to get the UART communication working. 
But I hope it may helps other Kernel interested persons to understand what happends in a Linux driver.
